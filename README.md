# PET Image Reconstruction Using Weighted Nuclear Norm Maximization and Deep Learning Prior

## Subject to intellectual property rights, the modules that can accelerate the forward and backward propagation of PET images cannot be open-sourced. We provide an alternative simulation framework for researchers to conduct experiments. The image matrix size is set to 128×128×4

## Test
- Modify the model save path (--checkpoints_dir) in the 01-TICCGAN/options/base_options.py file according to your running environment.
