# PET Image Reconstruction Using Weighted Nuclear Norm Maximization and Deep Learning Prior

## Subject to intellectual property rights, the modules that can accelerate the forward and backward propagation of PET images cannot be open-sourced. We provide an alternative simulation framework for researchers to conduct experiments. The image matrix size is set to 128×128×4
